##  Window Pattern Generator 
This project is a Python application that generates dynamic window patterns based on user input.
The program allows users to customize the size and colors of the window,
creating intricate and visually appealing designs.


##  Features 
Choose from predefined window sizes: 5x5, 7x7, or 9x9.
Select three unique colors to customize the pattern.
Generates patterns with various types of patches, including:
Plain color patches.
Intricate diagonal and grid designs.
Interactive and user-friendly input validation for seamless customization.


## How It Works  
The program starts by asking the user to select the window size (5, 7, or 9).
Users choose three distinct colors from the predefined palette: red, green, blue, magenta, orange, yellow, and cyan.
The application uses the graphics.py library to render the customized pattern in a graphical window.
Technologies Used
Language: Python
Library: graphics.py for drawing shapes and rendering visuals


## How to Run the Program 
Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
Install or place the graphics.py module in the same directory as this project.
Save the project code in a file (e.g., pattern_generator.py).
Run the file in your terminal or IDE:
bash
Copy code
python pattern_generator.py
Follow the prompts to enter your preferences for window size and colors.
Sample Output
A dynamically generated graphical window with intricate patterns based on user input.
